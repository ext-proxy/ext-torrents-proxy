# EXT Torrents Proxy

# Why Canâ€™t I Reach EXT Torrents?

There are a few reasons why you may not be able to get to EZTV when you want to download some content. Since it is a website, there is always the potential that it is not operating when you are looking for it. Perhaps they are moving the servers to a new location or something like that.

More likely, your access is being blocked by your ISP due to your geographic location. Some jurisdictions have strict laws against copyright infringement, and when you are downloading your torrents from those countries you might be breaking these laws. Your ISP may also block you to conserve bandwidth as they are aware of the type of activity that you will be engaged in when connected to EXT Torrents.
